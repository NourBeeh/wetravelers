# WeTravellers — KNOWN ISSUES / CAVEATS

## Historical
- TS2564 strict-property-initialization errors existed in older DTO/entity files outside the AI scope.
- Backend database boot/connectivity has been a separate concern.
- Live AI request was not validated without a real API key.
- Historical Flutter baseline was 55 passing tests and 0 analyze errors; revalidate.

## AI
- LLM output must be treated as untrusted input.
- JSON parsing/normalization should be hardened before production.
- Provider switching is currently a module binding decision.
- `AiResponseSource` may remain as a legacy/internal mock abstraction.

## Security — Pre-production gate (added 2026-08-21)
- `POST /api/duffel/create-booking` has NO auth guard (`@UseGuards`) and NO DTO
  validation (body typed as `any[]` for passengers/payments). It calls
  `duffelClient.orders.create({ type: 'instant', ... })` — a real, immediate
  booking against the configured Duffel token, not a draft/preview.
- Currently safe only because the backend runs on localhost with no external
  exposure. This becomes a live exploit path (unauthenticated real bookings)
  the moment the backend is reachable from outside the dev machine.
- Verify `DUFFEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `.env` is a sandbox/test token
  (`duffel_test_...`), not a live token, while this gap remains open.
- MUST be resolved (auth guard + typed DTO with class-validator) before any
  non-localhost deployment. Tracked against Phase 16 (auth) / Phase 17
  (booking hardening) — do not deploy `create-booking` publicly before then.

## UI — Pre-existing (added 2026-08-26)
- `hotel_card.dart:34` Column overflows by 76px with the demo home feed at
  small test viewports (800×600). Surfaced while testing the AI chat route;
  unrelated to AI work. Fix candidate: make the card's Column scroll-safe or
  cap its content. Not blocking on physical devices so far.

## Rule
Do not fix unrelated historical issues during a scoped phase unless the requested phase explicitly requires them.
## Wave workstreams (2026-09-02) — current state and open items

### Verified working
- Nuitee sandbox LIVE smoke passes with the user's key in `backend/.env` (`NUITEE_LIVE_SMOKE=1 npx jest --testPathPattern=nuitee.live-smoke`).
- Full app boots and walks all tabs without exceptions (`test/app/full_app_smoke_test.dart`); all 4 search pages interaction-tested; 432 Flutter + 129 backend tests green; debug APK builds.

### Open items (none blocking, all deliberate)
- **Nuitee key is in `.env` only** (git-ignored — verified). Never copy it into committed files.
- **Duffel flights**: `revalidateOffer` + provenance shipped; the funnel does NOT yet call Duffel `createOrder` end-to-end (book wiring is Phase 19 remaining).
- **Nuitee book** (`/rates/book`) adapter method exists and is contract-tested, but the Flutter funnel does not yet pass prebookId/transactionId into a real hotel booking (Phase 19 remaining).
- **Payments**: MockEgyptGateway only. Real Egyptian PSP selection/onboarding pending (spec §K). `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_EG_REF` documented in `.env.example` but unset.
- **Booking persistence**: payments ledger + gateway state are in-memory service state; the spec §49 DB tables (bookings, payments, ledger_entries, fx_rates, webhook_events…) are NOT migrated yet.
- **Favorites**: heart toggles are presentational; no persistence service yet (leftover from card sub-phase 24C).
- **Home feed**: backend-driven via `GET /home/sections` + seed; when backend is down/empty the dev-preview fallback renders skeleton items (by design — no fake data).
- **Cars**: mock catalogue only (spec point 30 defers vendor selection).
- **`/ai` route**: still a placeholder; the real assistant is `/ai-chat`. The AI-mode visual shell page exists unrouted.
- **Known historical security gate (pre-production)**: `POST /api/duffel/create-booking` still has no auth guard/DTO validation — must be gated before production (unchanged from the 2026-08-21 note above).

## Phase 0 discovery audit (2026-09-03) — verified against actual code

### BLOCKER — Booking endpoints do not exist server-side
Flutter `lib/core/repositories/booking_repository_impl.dart` calls `POST /bookings/prepare`, `POST /bookings/revalidate`, and `POST /bookings` — **none of these routes exist anywhere in the backend** (no bookings module/controller/entity; full route inventory verified). Additional adjacent facts: `BookingRepositoryImpl.getBooking/cancelBooking/getBookingStatus` throw `UnimplementedError`; the checkout flow uses a synthetic `bookingId` (`booking-${timestamp}`); `BookingConfirmationPage` fabricates the Bag `TripSummary` (random `WT-xxxxxx` reference, placeholder destination/dates); backend Duffel `createOrder` and Nuitee `book` exist but are not called from the funnel. **Follow-up required before any real booking work: decide the backend bookings API shape (or remove/disable the client calls) — do NOT create endpoints ad-hoc in unrelated phases.**

### R-4 wiring gaps (backend capability exists, no consumer)
- Flutter never calls `POST /events` (no event tracking client; no `deviceId` generation in lib/), `GET/PATCH /profile/me`, or `GET /geo/country`.
- `ProfileService.setCountry`/`setCountryIfMoreConfident` have no production caller (tests only) — geo detection never lands in the profile.
- `POST /events` carries `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)`; the guest/deviceId path is coded defensively but is not actually reachable (standard guard rejects unauthenticated calls). If guest events are wanted, the guard needs an optional-JWT variant.

### AI
- `backend/.env` still contains `AI_FALLBACK_PROVIDER=mock` — dead line, unread by code (the binding was removed). Left untouched to avoid modifying a file holding the live API key. `.env.example` now documents the removal.
- `AI_FALLBACK_PROVIDER` DI token symbol still exported from `ai.provider.ts` but is not bound anywhere.
- AI Arabic flight fast-path (`extractTravelSearchData`) returns raw provider prices — bypasses MarketContext/PricingEngine (no EGP customerPrice enrichment on that path).

### Orphaned / dead code (verify before reuse)
- `backend/src/database/entities/offer.entity.ts` — `offers` table registered by no module; never read/written.
- `session.entity.ts` — `sessions` table defined; `auth.service.ts` logout notes server-side revocation "deferred until the Sessions table is activated".
- `lib/features/bag/domain/price_watch.dart` (`WatchItem`) — domain model, zero references anywhere.
- `moveToPast()` in `bag_controller.dart` and `ItineraryStage` — implemented, no callers.
- `lib/features/ai/application/search_intent_parser.dart` — dead code (EN/AR parser, unused).

### Test coverage regressions from the R-4 deletions (accepted, documented)
- `nuitee.contract.spec.ts` deleted with `NUITEE_FIXTURES`: the deterministic offline Rates→Prebook→Book mapping coverage is gone (live-smoke remains, gated by `NUITEE_LIVE_SMOKE=1`).
- `ai_bottom_sheet_test.dart` deleted (user-approved): `AiSheetController`/`AiBottomSheetContent` currently have NO widget test coverage after the single-service simplification.
- `EventsService.recent/recentByDevice` are only exercised by tests — no controller exposes them.
