/// response body there and socket failures carry host/port — so publishing
/// `error.toString()` would put API response details, provider/internal
/// errors, network topology and secrets on screen. Instead every [ApiError]
/// subtype maps to a fixed, safe phrase and anything else falls back to a
/// generic message.
///
/// This is the same boundary used by `AiController`. Reuses the existing
/// [ApiError] hierarchy — no new error type is introduced. The switch is
/// exhaustive over the sealed class, so adding a new [ApiError] subtype fails
/// the build instead of silently leaking again.
